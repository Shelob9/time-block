## Entry Points

This template has one "entry point" with the handle of  "admin". It is used for a custom admin page. If you want to add additional entry points, for example if you want to add blocks or to have separate JavaScript/ CSS for the front-end, follow these steps:

## To Add A New Entry Point

- Choose a one word handle for the entry point
- Create a directory named for the handle.
- Add an index.js file to that directory
- Add the handle to the array `entryPoints` in webpack.config.js
- Run `yarn build`
- Check that `build/$handle.js` and `build/$handle.asset.php` where created.

## Local Development

Feel free to supply your own local development environment of choice. [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/packages/packages-env/) will work without any configuration, if you have Docker installed:

```vue
npx wp-env start
```
